# Pull requests and Review 
 * This guide explains what pull requests are and how to review them on GitHub. 
 * Pull requests are a key part of collaboration on coding projects.

## What is a Pull Request?
 * A pull request (PR) is a way to suggest changes to a project.. 
 * It lets you ask others to review your code before merging it into the main project.
 Here’s how it works:

 1. **You Make Changes**: You create a branch in the repository and make your changes (like adding new features or fixing bugs).

 2. **Open a Pull Request**: Once you are happy with your changes, you open a pull request to request that your changes be merged into the main branch.

 3. Review and Discuss**: Team members can review your code, leave comments, and discuss the changes.

 ## How to Create a Pull Request

 1. **Create a Branch**: 
    * Start by creating a new branch for your changes. 
    * Use a clear name that describes what you’re working on.

 2. **Make Your Changes**: Make the necessary changes in your code.

 3. **Push Your Branch**: Push your branch to the GitHub repository.

 4. **Open a Pull Request**:
   * Go to the Pull requests tab in your repository.
   * Click New pull request.
   * Choose your branch and click Create pull request.
   * Add a title and description explaining your changes.

## How to Review a Pull Request
When someone creates a pull request, you can check it in these ways:

1. **Check the Changes**: Click on the pull request to see the changes made. You can view the code side by side with the original.

2. **Leave Comments**: If you have feedback or questions, you can leave comments directly on the lines of code.

3 **Approve or Request Changes**: Once you are satisfied:
  * Click Approve to accept the changes.
  * Click Request changes if you think further modifications are needed.

## Merging a Pull Request
After approval the pull request can be merged into the main branch:

1. Click the **Merge pull request** button.
2. Confirm the merge.
3. Optionally, delete the branch if it’s no longer needed.

Note:-
* Pull requests are really important for working together on code.
