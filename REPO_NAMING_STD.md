# How to name the github repo

* This guide will help you choose a good name for your GitHub repository. 
* Clear and meaningful name makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand the project.

## Best Practices for Naming a GitHub Repository
1. **Keep It Short and Descriptive**
* The name should be brief but describe what the project is about.
* For example, instead of `my-awesome-project-123`, use something like `weather-app` or `task-manager`.

2. **Use Hyphens Instead of Spaces**
* Since GitHub repository names can't have spaces, use hyphens `(-)` to separate words.
* Example: `my-project` instead of `my project`.

3. **Avoid Special Characters**
* Stick to letters, numbers, and hyphens. Avoid using symbols like `@`, `#`, or `&`, as they can cause issues or confusion.

4. **Make It Unique**
* Ensure the name is unique and not too similar to existing repositories, especially if you're collaborating or open-sourcing the project. 
* GitHub will tell you if the name is already taken by someone else.

5. **Reflect the Project’s Purpose**
Try to make the name reflect what the repository is for. For example:
* For a to-do list app, use `todo-app`.
* For a portfolio website, use `portfolio-site`.

6. **Use Lowercase Letters**
* It’s common practice to use lowercase letters for GitHub repository names, like `my-repo` instead of `MyRepo`.

7. **Consistency Across Projects**
* If you’re creating multiple repositories for related projects, keep a consistent naming convention.
* For example, `client-app`, `server-app`, and `api-service`.

## Examples of Good Repository Names
* `personal-website`
* `weather-app`
* `blog-engine`
* `machine-learning-project`
* `recipe-tracker`

Note:-
* A well-named GitHub repository is easy to remember and understand.
