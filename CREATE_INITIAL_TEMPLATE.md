# ⁠How to create inital template in GitHub
* This guide provides instructions on how to create an initial template for a GitHub repository.
* A template allows you to start a new project with a predefined structure and common files, saving time and ensuring consistency across projects.

## Requirements
Before creating an initial template in GitHub, make sure you have the following:
* A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* Git installed on your local machine (optional but recommended for cloning repositories).
  
* Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub.
   1. **Git**: A tool used to track changes in code (version control).
      - You can save your work, undo changes, and collaborate with others.
   3. **GitHub**: A platform where you can store your code online and collaborate with others using Git.

## Steps to Create an Initial Template
### 1. Create a New Repository
 1. Log in to your GitHub
    
 2. Click the + icon in the upper-right corner and select New repository.
 3. Name your repository (e.g. `project-template`).
 4. Optionally, add a description.
 5. Choose Public or Private visibility for the repository.
 6. Check the box for "Initialize this repository with a README" if you'd like a default README file.
 7. Optionally select: 
     * **.gitignore**: Choose a language or framework to automatically include commonly ignored files.
     * **License**: Select an open-source license.
 8. Click Create repository.


### 2. Add Template Files
Once the repository is created, you can start adding files:
* **README.md**: This file will explain the purpose of the template and provide instructions.
* **.gitignore**: A file that specifies which files or directories Git should ignore.
* **LICENSE**: Include an appropriate open-source license.
* **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for contributing to the project.
* **CODE_OF_CONDUCT**.md: A code of conduct for community interaction.


#### To add files:
1. Click on **Add file** > **Create new file**.
2. Name your file (e.g. `README.md`), then add the content in the editor.
3. Click **Commit new file**.

Repeat the process for all the necessary files you want to include in your template.

### 3. Make the Repository a Template
* After adding the desired files, you can turn the repository into a template.
* This allows others to create new repositories based on your structure:
   1. Go to the **Settings** tab of your repository.
   2. Scroll down to the **Template Repository** section.
   3. Check the box labeled **Template repository**.
   4. Click **Save changes**.

### 4. Using the Template
Now that the repository is set up as a template, you can use it to start new projects:
1. Go to your template repository on GitHub.
2. Click the green Use this template button.
3. Fill in the details for your new repository (name, description, etc).
4. Click Create repository from template.

Note :-
- The new repository will be created with the same structure and files as the template.
- you can create and reuse this structure for future projects!
